## Description

This code implements an analysis of how exposure in key developmental windows (early life and adolescence) and repeated exposure to natural hazards affects symptoms of anxiety and depression in young adulthood in Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam. 

Individual scripts for each country are titled: 

  - Ethiopia (`et_script_clean.R`)
  - India (`et_script_clean.R`)
  - Peru (`pe_script_clean.R`)  
  - Vietnam (`vt_script_clean.R`)
  
The data to undertake this analysis can be requested from the [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000060). 

Information on how to set up data files, automated cleaning functions, and initial R scripts can be found at [Young Lives Data Preparation](https://github.com/ilan-cerna-turoff/young_lives_data_preparation). Accompanying standards on data preparation can be found in the publication [Cerna-Turoff et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/ije/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ije/dyad066/7172837?utm_source=authortollfreelink&utm_campaign=ije&utm_medium=email&guestAccessKey=b12147e0-c4ee-4f9d-9952-6f784ab9aa07).
